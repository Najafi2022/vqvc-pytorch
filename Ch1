we propose a vector quantization (VQ) based
one-shot voice conversion (VC) approach without any supervision
on speaker label. We model the content embedding
as a series of discrete codes and take the difference between
quantize-before and quantize-after vector as the speaker embedding.
We show that this approach has a strong ability to
disentangle the content and speaker information with reconstruction
loss only, and one-shot VC is thus achieved
